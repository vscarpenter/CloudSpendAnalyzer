# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a command-line interface (CLI) tool that integrates with AWS CLI and credentials to provide users with an intuitive way to explore and query their AWS cost and billing data. The tool will allow users to ask natural language questions about their cloud spending and receive simple, text-based answers about costs across different AWS services, time periods, and usage patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want to query my EC2 costs for specific time periods, so that I can understand my compute spending patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the CLI with a query like "how much is EC2 costing me per month" THEN the system SHALL return the current month's EC2 costs in a readable format
2. WHEN I specify a different time period for EC2 costs THEN the system SHALL return costs for that specific period
3. WHEN EC2 cost data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cost optimization analyst, I want to query costs for specific AWS services, so that I can identify high-spending services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query costs for a specific service like S3 THEN the system SHALL return cost data for that service
2. WHEN I ask for yearly costs for a service THEN the system SHALL aggregate and display the annual spending
3. WHEN I query an invalid or non-existent service THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want to get my total AWS bill information, so that I can track overall cloud spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask for "total bill for the year" THEN the system SHALL return the aggregated costs across all services for the current year
2. WHEN I request monthly total costs THEN the system SHALL return the current month's total spending
3. WHEN I specify a custom date range for total costs THEN the system SHALL calculate and return costs for that period

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the CLI to use my existing AWS credentials and profiles, so that I don't need to configure additional authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI runs THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and use existing AWS CLI credentials and profiles
2. WHEN AWS credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for setting up credentials
3. WHEN credentials lack necessary permissions THEN the system SHALL display specific permission requirements for Cost Explorer and Billing APIs
4. WHEN multiple AWS profiles exist THEN the system SHALL support profile selection via command line options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions in natural language, so that I can interact with the tool intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I input a natural language query about costs THEN the system SHALL parse and understand the intent
2. WHEN my query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification or provide suggestions
3. WHEN I use common variations of cost-related questions THEN the system SHALL recognize and respond appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive simple text-based responses, so that I can quickly understand my cost information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system returns cost data THEN it SHALL format the response in clear, readable text
2. WHEN displaying monetary amounts THEN the system SHALL use appropriate currency formatting
3. WHEN showing time-based data THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the time period and dates covered

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the CLI to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate guidance
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retry timing
4. WHEN AWS API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching to reduce subsequent API calls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the CLI to be built with Python and leverage proven libraries, so that it's reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI is implemented THEN it SHALL use Python with boto3 for AWS integration
2. WHEN building the CLI interface THEN the system SHALL use Click or Typer framework for robust command-line handling
3. WHEN processing cost data THEN the system SHALL use pandas for data manipulation and analysis
4. WHEN formatting terminal output THEN the system SHALL use Rich library for enhanced readability

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the CLI to integrate with LLM services for natural language processing, so that I can ask questions in plain English.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing natural language queries THEN the system SHALL use an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or AWS Bedrock) to extract structured parameters
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use LLM services to format cost data into natural language
3. WHEN LLM services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality with basic query parsing
4. WHEN using LLM services THEN the system SHALL support configuration for different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, or local Ollama)

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the CLI to cache cost data appropriately, so that repeated queries are fast and don't hit AWS rate limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost data is retrieved from AWS THEN the system SHALL cache results for a configurable time period
2. WHEN the same query is made within the cache period THEN the system SHALL return cached data instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN cache expires or user requests fresh data THEN the system SHALL fetch new data from AWS APIs
4. WHEN cache storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue to function without caching
